# LeetCode-Problems

Welcome to my LeetCode repository! This repository contains my solutions to various coding problems from LeetCode, a popular platform for practicing coding skills through algorithmic challenges.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each representing a specific problem or category. Inside each folder, you will find the following files:

- **README.md file**: A Markdown file describing the problem statement, constraints, and examples.
- **Program File (ex: .java, .js or .c)**: A program file containing my solution to the problem.
